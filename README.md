You can start the game as following :
open terminal, write pry, load game.rb and make an instance of the Game class :

    game1 = Game.new(5, x: false, y: true)
        5 => is the size of the grid
        x: and y: => are marks of the players
        true => if U want the player to be the computer.
        false => if U want the player to be a human
    .
